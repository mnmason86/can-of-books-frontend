### Make a list of each parson’s strengths. 
Kyel: Communication, innovation, backend 
Mandy: Communication, leadership, support, frontend

### How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application? 
Have Kyel take the lead with Driving on the back end, and Mandy on the front end

### In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength? 
Kyel: Collaboration and working with a team Mandy: Working with the backend and understanding the syntax better

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development? 
Be sure to explain what is going on, ask good questions and give feedback.

##Conflict Resolution

### What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
 We are both motivated to get our work done, and do not anticipate that as a problem, but, we would have a conversation about the amount we are contributing and what needs to happen.

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute? 
Same as if one person is pulling all the weight. Have a conversation about what is happening currently, and what changes need to be made.

### How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? 
Support each other with our strengths, knowing that we are strong/weak in different areas.
